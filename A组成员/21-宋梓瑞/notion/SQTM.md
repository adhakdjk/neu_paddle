# test strategy
- how testing is oganized?
# test phases
- parts of a test project which are time boxed 
  # types
# domains


# Basic test phase
- unit testing -developers  test every part of code
- integration testing- test team   run the units see if any problems
- System testing -test team
- Implementation tseting -ICT operations  deplopy it to see if it's fine to run
- user acceptance testing - the business

# test objectives
-  the fundamental objectives are to get the system to a point where its fit for 


# 
-  interface testing: it is the interface between the two systems, how to systems are interfacing with each other.

# test domains


# building a test plan
analyse the system->define test objectives->determine test deliverabels->design test strategy->define test criteria ->define workload->allocate resources->set up the enviroment->Build schedule of work.

Part 2
# Testing types
- blackbox testing -don't konw what is in it .
- whitebox  testing - we have got every ting about  
- greybox testing -know some of things
- smoke testing- it looks very fine
- sanity testing-the sametings as smoke testing
  - The purpose of smoke testing is to prevent the QA team from wasting time and resources on poorly coded.

So, these are the techniques which help us in understanding that if we are going to test the system that will waste our money or not. So, in journal, the smoke test and sanity tests are same thing but few of the text or organization which have declared some differences in them. For example, with the smoke tests.
They go for checking if the system is ready for testing with the sanity test, they look for
- exploratory testing- bugs not found 
  - occurs during system intergration testing -it it normaly triggered when there is a suspiccion that some bugs are not being found through planning
- guerilla testing
- specialist testing
